Description: Several web services are available that provide access to elevation
             data. This package provides access to several of those services and 
             returns elevation data either as a SpatialPointsDataFrame from 
             point elevation services or as a raster object from raster 
             elevation services.  Currently, the package supports access to the
             Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles <https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/> 
             and the USGS Elevation Point Query Service <http://ned.usgs.gov/epqs/>.
